 Please go into the runner class to play the game. Hard mode consists of the wall moving towards the user at a random pace, 
 (up to three meters per second). The user gets points with regard to how closely they launch the projectile over 
 with respect to the walls height. They get five points if they are within three meters. two points within 3 and 10
 and 1 point if they just make it over.
